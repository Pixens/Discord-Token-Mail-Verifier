## Planned

> + 100 stars: Improved headers, which means it gets patched slower, would work better and provide higher quality tokens.



Send me some money if you are going to skid. My LTC address: LPBUWzJ1aaFccTfnExCpQetJdwMy1VLZ8f.
Do not DM me for help, I will ignore you and block you. I cannot explain on how to use it better than I already have.
