This tool is used to verify email of any discord token. It can claim a tokens as well.

NOT WORKING RIGHT NOW, FIX AT 60 stars

## How To Run?
> 1) Clone / download this repository.
> 2) Open the folder in command prompt or terminal.
> 3) Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
> 4) Put proxies in  `input/proxies.txt`, format: `username:password@host:port` or `ip:port`.
> 5) Put Kopeechka (https://kopeechka.store/?ref=22668) API key in `config.yml` after adding balance to the key.
> 4) Run `python main.py`.


## Planned
> + 100 stars: Improved headers, which means it gets patched slower, would work better and provide higher quality tokens.



Send me some money if you are going to skid. My LTC address: LPBUWzJ1aaFccTfnExCpQetJdwMy1VLZ8f.
Do not DM me for help, I will ignore you and block you. I cannot explain on how to use it better than I already have.
